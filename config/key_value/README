This directory contains the system defaults. If you want to override any
value, create links with the same name on subdirectory local/. Please, don't
change any link on this base directory.

NOTE: some values like apache_virtwww_homedir and
mysql_instances_homedir cannot be overwritten yet, as they are hardcoded on
some binaries, e.g. suexec and will break the system if overwritten.
